##  Application Configuration

In this lab you will learn how to manage application configuration and how to provide environment 
specific configuration to the services.

#### Application Configuration

Most applications require configuration using environment variables,
configuration files and command line arguments. These configuration artifacts
should be externalized form the application and the docker image content in
order to keep the image portable across environments.

In link:databases[previous labs], the `nationalparks` application was configured
with database credentials using environment variables. While environment
variables is a useful way to configure applications, it is difficult to manage
hundreds of environment variables which are scattered across various containers
in a project. Fortunately, there is a convenient and platform-independent
mechanism in OpenShift to configure applications, which is called `ConfigMap`.

The `ConfigMap` object in OpenShift provides mechanisms to provide configuration
data to the application container while keeping the application images both
portable across environments and independent of OpenShift Container Platform. A
`ConfigMap` can be used to store key-value properties, configuration files, JSON
blobs and alike.

In this lab, you will replace the environment variables provided in the
link:databases[previous labs] and use a `ConfigMap` instead to configure the
`nationalparks` application.

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
